    name: Angela Roman
    position: National Account Executive, Boundless
    testimonial: "The Crumpled Letter has been an absolute game changer for me while I'm trying to open doors and conversations. Before I was just spinning my wheels and having a really hard time getting people to talk to me. This has really helped me to see that I can be different and give people a unique experience, and because of that they will invite me in to show them what I offer."

    name: Corey Fowler
    position: Technical Recruiting Specialist, Paragon IT
    testimonial: "I had tried everything in my territory and nothing worked - nobody would take a meeting. My coworkers all told me the territory was really difficult and they weren't surprised I wasn't booking any meetings. So, I tried out the Crumpled Letter. I only dropped off a total of 30 letters, and I set 14 meetings with decision makers in just one week. The letter is memorable and it definitely works."

    name: Jelena Markovic
    position: Senior Sales Manager, Package AI
    testimonial: "I am over in Europe but my prospects are in the United States. So, I sent my letters to a colleague in the U.S. to send them out for me. My favorite story is the first response I got from a letter, which was an email with the subject line: WTF. They loved the letter and offered me a job. I've gotten a few other job offers too but I sold 7 new accounts really quickly from the letter and got promoted, so I didn't need those other offers."
  - image: "/assets/images/jarreau-gilbert.webp"
    name: Jarreau Gilbert
    position: Enterprise Sales Account Manager, Global Office Inc
    testimonial: "I think it's pretty hilarious that there are people out there that are skeptical when they haven't even tried the Crumpled Letter. What have you got to lose when nothing else is working anyway? You gotta be different...I went from literally ZERO deals to single-handedly increasing my branch's revenue by 60% in just one year."
  - image: "/assets/images/phillip-chambers.webp"
    name: Phillip Chambers
    position: Senior AE, Torch Dental
    testimonial: "I was able to set meetings by just pounding the phones, but it was really grueling. I joined a Rebel Squadron and started using the Crumpled Letter and Letter Campaign and got some really good results right away. When other AE's were struggling, I was able to build my pipeline and in just the second month of using the campaign, I hit over 200% of my monthly quota. I'm excited to see continued results!"
  - image: "/assets/images/amanda-steel.webp"
    name: Amanda Steel
    position: Account Executive, Newsela
    testimonial: "I was a little nervous to use the Crumpled Letter, because I sell to large school districts and sometimes people in academia are very straight-laced. I didn't know how it would be received but I decided to try it anyway since everything else had little effect. The very first letter I dropped off, the decision maker called me on my cell before I left the parking lot! I've had some other really good successes so far as well."
