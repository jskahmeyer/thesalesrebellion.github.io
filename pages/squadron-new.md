        <p class="text-center">The Rebel Squadron isn’t for everyone—and that’s how we like it. If you’re looking for quick-fix tricks or sleazy shortcuts to catch prospects in a weak moment, this is not your crew. If you’re not ready to put others’ needs above your own or you think sales is just a numbers game, you’re in the wrong place. But if you want to play the long game, trust in your coaches who’ve been where you are, and are ready to commit to 6 months of all-out Rebellion, then strap in—because the Squadron is where legends are made!</p>
