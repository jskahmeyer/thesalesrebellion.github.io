  - name: Creative Campaign Fulfillment
    description: |
      * NEW IN 2025! *
      Without a doubt, keeping up with creative campaigns is THE hardest thing for Rebels to do. Even though it‚Äôs fun and produces great results, the effort can still be daunting.

      To destroy that roadblock, The Rebellion will be doing most of the work for you. You‚Äôll create 3 of the most successful Rebel campaigns with us, and then we‚Äôll take it from there - all you have to do is open up a few boxes that arrive on your doorstep and drop the items in the mail to your prospects (or in-person if you‚Äôre in a local territory) If you are an International Rebel student, make sure you click the appropriate button when signing up for the Squadron.
  - name: Bi-Weekly Situation Room
    description: This is where you‚Äôll get practical advice from a long-time Rebel coach with success as an individual rep and in leading teams. You‚Äôll role-play follow-ups and other sales situations in a live (virtual) meet, understand the WHY of Rebel methods, develop deeper emotional intelligence, and learn how to close the next step like a Rebel, not by wearing someone down or catching them in a weak moment.
  - name: Campaign Creation Forums
    description: Work boots required. (or maybe just internet access and an open mind) You‚Äôll be creating three of the most successful Rebel campaigns with a creative kingpin who learned 1:1 from the Leader of the Rebellion himself, Dale Dupree. We‚Äôll refine copy based on your industry, product, and service, and get everything prepped and ready for the Rebellion team to fulfill it for you!
  - name: Squadron-Only Comms Channel
    description: Stay up-to-date and keep your fellow Squadron mates sharp in a private Slack channel, where you can get quick answers and advice from Rebel coaches and your new friends. Share your wins, losses, encourage each other‚Ä¶with maybe some friendly trolling mixed in.
  - name: The Roots, R.E.A.S.O.N, Living Pipeline, and I.N.V.A.S.I.O.N Courses
    description: The Rebel Squadron focuses most on the R.E.A.S.O.N. method of prospecting to build a large and healthy pipeline. While that‚Äôs the main goal, you‚Äôll have other needs! In addition to feedback from coaches, you‚Äôll have lifetime access to more education through easy-to-digest courses. The R.E.A.S.O.N. course is a no-brainer inclusion, but you‚Äôll also dig further into the healthy Rebel mindset with Roots, get additional insight on pipeline nurturing with The Living Pipeline, and see how Rebels run a sales process with I.N.V.A.S.I.O.N.
  - name: The 'Everything and the Kitchen Sink' Letter Campaign Tutorial
    description: Rebel Squadron members get complementary fulfillment of three campaigns, the most well-known of which is the Legendary Letters - our most famous tool for generating billions in pipeline for sellers around the globe. While 95% of this work will be done for you when you‚Äôre a Squadron member, your lifetime access to the full tutorial helps add context to the outreach, gives you additional ideas if you want to expand the campaign, and simply provides everything you need if you want to execute it on your own after your time in the Squadron ends.
  - name: Rebelicious Swag
    description: Fleece sweaters with a company logo. Cheap tumblers. Drawstring bags whose strings fall out after 2 uses. Most swag sucks. But if you enjoy the Rebellion brand, you already know you‚Äôll love every single swag item we send you to represent yourself as a true Rebel in a world of copycats.
  - name: Exclusive Discounts on All Things Rebellious
    description: Enjoy special rates on everything, from 1:1 coaching, another Squadron, Totality (annual Rebel live event), other Rebel campaign tutorials, courses, and merch. As a current student or alumnus, you get first-look at new products and discounts everyone else wishes they could get.

sessions:
  - name: Preparing for Change, Rebellion, and Fun
    details: "You‚Äôll start shifting some perspectives on communication right from Session 1 as you and your fellow Squadron members discuss how sales outreach is currently done (hint: it‚Äôs been the same for decades), how Rebels do it, and what it will take to move away from outdated methods and fully embrace your own Rebellion."
  - name: Handling common sales situations like a Rebel
    details: By this point, you will have already created a campaign in a Campaign Creation Forum, and it will be on its way to get the attention of your prospects. In this session, you‚Äôll practically apply concepts of Rebel prospecting - conversational and proactive language, piquing curiosity, and adding emotional context. Simple concepts to understand, but hard to know ‚ÄúWhat do they actually sound like in a sales conversation?‚Äù Wonder no more‚Ä¶
  - name: Fellowship in the Follow-Up
    details: You‚Äôve heard the fortune is in the follow-up‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs not wrong. But the ultimate fortune is not some closed sales, but by building genuine relationships. In this session, you‚Äôll live role-play your follow-up to your Rebel campaigns that have arrived in your prospect‚Äôs hands. Your coach will show you how to start a relationship in your follow-up and naturally close the next step (demo/meeting/round of golf/glass of bubble tea) by seeking to serve your prospect, not yourself.
  - name: Rebels Overruling Objections
    details: Chuck Norris, the ultimate Rebel himself, simply answers prospect objections by saying ‚ÄúOverruled‚Äù, and moving on. üôÇ But nobody other than Chuck can do that, so you‚Äôre going to practice a different way. You, your Squadron mates, and your coach will discuss what is and what is not an objection, stupid simple ways to help prospects willingly give you more details, how to drop ‚Äòlandmines‚Äô that stop your prospect in their tracks and pique their interest, and‚Ä¶when/how to disqualify and move on.
  - name: Building Credibility
    details: Trust and Credibility - it‚Äôs key if you want someone to go from ‚Äòcuriosity aroused‚Äô to ‚Äòin an active buying process‚Äô. You‚Äôve created an experience for your prospect through your Rebel campaign‚Ä¶in this session, you‚Äôll dig into more ways to continue that experience in your follow-up.
  - name: Refining Your Conversation
    details: By this point, you‚Äôve had a fair number of conversations with prospects who have received multiple campaign pieces! You might be a Rebel savant and knocking everyone dead with your skills‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs more likely you‚Äôve got some things to work on. In this session, you‚Äôll be calling your prospects live while your Squadron listens in! It‚Äôs definitely uncomfortable, but amazing for your growth to have this live guidance from your coach right after you‚Äôve talked to a real prospect.
  - name: Checkpoint - How far you‚Äôve come and where you‚Äôre going
    details: You‚Äôre just past the halfway mark of your time in the Squadron, and we‚Äôve already created and deployed your second campaign together! At this juncture of your journey, there are some specific situations and scenarios that are different from when we started. You‚Äôve built pipeline, you‚Äôve disqualified prospects, you‚Äôve had some unresponsive folks‚Ä¶in this session, we‚Äôll discuss the different scenarios, your mindset going into further outreach, and set yourself up for a great 2nd half.
  - name: The Art of Storytelling in Sales
    details: You‚Äôve been told before - ‚Äúlearn how to tell good stories‚Äù. Easier said than done. There‚Äôs a reason they work, but there‚Äôs also good reasons why barely any salespeople effectively use the concept of storytelling. While it takes fine-tuning and practice, applying the concepts you‚Äôll learn in this session to your conversations will be a massive help.
  - name: The Rules of Pleasant Persistence
    details: Your Living Pipeline is now full of different members - the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Interested‚Äù gang, the ‚ÄúGive me 6 months‚Äù club, Whales and Walruses, and others. Most salespeople let their wildest income dreams leak steadily from their pipeline without even realizing it. But not you, Rebel. This session will help you be the most pleasantly persistent person your prospects have ever met.
  - name: Practice Makes Perfect
    details: You are 75% done with your Squadron, and we‚Äôve created and deployed your 3rd Rebel campaign. This is a role play exclusive session - bring convo scenarios that have stumped you in the field to role-play with your coach. Or if you just need some simple fine-tuning on your talk track, active listening, and other skills, this is a whole session of practice!
  - name: Live Skills Challenge
    details: While you‚Äôre still learning more about the Rebel Way and developing daily, we want to make sure you are supremely confident in your conversations as your Squadron nears its end. You practiced with your coach and fellow Squadron members in the last session, you tested their feedback in the field, and now you get to put it into practice live (again) while calling prospects in the Squadron session. This will be a rollicking session that is so eye-opening for students to see how far they‚Äôve come. And there just might be prizes‚Ä¶
  - name: Graduation and What‚Äôs Next
    details: This final session will include a final live Q&A with your coach, a time of review and reflection, and a special guest speaker. There‚Äôs sure to be laughs, there might be some tears, and we‚Äôll discuss how to not lose momentum as you leave the Squadron!
bonuses:
  - about: "The ‚ÄòUnwritten Story‚Äô Campaign Guide"
    image: "/img/squadron/unwritten-story.webp"
    details: "In addition to The Rebel Letter Campaign, The Unwritten Story Campaign will be fulfilled for you by the Rebellion. This campaign has been responsible for generating business with some of the most recognizable names in the world, including McDonald‚Äôs, Darden Restaurants, Marriott International, Shaw Flooring, and Lenovo to name a few. This is the ultimate ‚Äòfeel-good‚Äô touch for a prospect and brings a WOW factor that‚Äôs stronger than almost any other campaign you could use when reaching out to executives at large companies. And while you‚Äôll have your campaign fulfilled by the Rebellion, this comprehensive tutorial will equip you to do it yourself in the future, if you choose."
  - about: "The ‚ÄòRebel Resume‚Äô Campaign Guide"
    image: "/img/squadron/rebel-resume.webp"
    details: "This is the third and final Rebel campaign that we will build with you and fulfill FOR you. The Rebel Resume is another market tool to help you break through the noise of emails, calls, and social messages that your prospects receive on a daily basis. And this campaign isn‚Äôt just for prospecting at a current job. Many Rebels have used the campaign to successfully land a new gig!"
  - about: "The Rebel‚Äôs Living Pipeline Postcard Campaign"
    image: "/img/squadron/postcard-pack.webp"
    details: |
      You will receive 100 postcards (for different sales scenarios) printed and delivered to you from the Rebellion, for sending when the time is right.

      Even when prospects love your approach, they won‚Äôt always be ready to engage immediately in a sales process. Rebels know that the first interaction is just the beginning of a relationship and that the unique experience we bring doesn‚Äôt stop at the first touch. Use these simple and hilarious postcards to stay top-of-mind with prospects and become the first and only choice for them when the timing aligns.
  - about: The Ghost Bundle
    image: "/img/squadron/ghost-bundle.webp"
    details: Ever had a prospect go dark? You‚Äôre not alone! Even the strongest Rebels still get ghosted sometimes. Reviving ghosts is best done with audacity, and The Ghost Bundle gives you proven pieces that have plenty of it to help you even further on your way to becoming ‚Äòun-ignorable‚Äô.
  - about: "How to Start a Sales Rebellion: The Copier Warrior‚Äôs Guide to Sales and Life (hardback copy)"
    image: "/img/squadron/copier-warrior.webp"
    details: "This book walks you through the rebellious approach that connects with prospects. On top of that, there‚Äôs a life altering truth that resides deep within these pages and is sure to reshape the way you see your life and career. At the highest level, this book deconstructs and
redefines the core fundamentals that are required for sales success. It acknowledges the changing nature of the marketplace and equips sales reps and sales leaders with the ability to connect, create, and communicate in the ways that B2 B buyer‚Äôs desires."
  - about: Mystery Bonus
    image: "/img/squadron/mystery-bundle.webp"
    details: We couldn‚Äôt be fully rebellious if there weren‚Äôt a little intrigue‚Ä¶ even though you don‚Äôt know what this bonus is, we guarantee you‚Äôre going to love it.
