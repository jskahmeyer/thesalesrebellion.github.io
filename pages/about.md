  heading: Things we get asked
  items:
  - q: What are you Rebelling against?
    a: |-
      We are rebelling against the status quo sales results and interactions. We believe the marketplace is yearning for creative, engaging, and authentic sales interactions. And we help businesses and individuals understand how to offer creative experiences this in the modern sales environment.
  - q: How can I join what you all are doing?
    a: |-
      Being a Sales Rebel is simple… Just believe. Believe that human engagement is as valuable as net margin. Believe that creativity and fun are not only allowed in business but they are the missing links. Believe that others are out there fighting for the same as you…. That’s what makes you a Rebel. There are tons of resources and community members. Just get involved!
